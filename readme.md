# ADAS Dataset Analysis

This repository contains the analysis of the Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) dataset, focusing on understanding the occurrence and characteristics of various alerts generated by vehicles equipped with ADAS. The analysis covers spatial distribution, alert frequency, speed analysis, correlation analysis, driver behavior analysis, and safety impact analysis.

## Dataset Description

The dataset comprises approximately 1.8 million records of ADAS alerts recorded within India. There are 8 types of alerts, including Lane Departure Warning, Headway Monitoring and Warning, Hard Brake, Pedestrian Collision Warning, Forward Collision Warning, Driver Distracted, No Seatbelt, and Smoking while Driving.

## Analytics

### Spatial Analysis

The spatial distribution plot illustrates the occurrence of ADAS alerts across India, highlighting concentrations around urban areas and major highways.

### Alert Frequency Analysis

Insights into the frequency and circumstances of alert occurrences are provided, revealing patterns based on alert types, days of the week, and speed ranges.

### Speed Analysis

The analysis explores the relationship between vehicle speed and alert occurrences, offering insights into driving behavior captured by the ADAS dataset.

### Correlation Analysis

Examines the relationship between alert occurrences and various road conditions or factors through a correlation matrix heatmap.

### Driver Behavior Analysis

Provides insights into the prevalence of different alert types, highlighting the distribution of alerts captured by the driver assistance system.

### Safety Impact Analysis

Investigates the relationship between vehicle speed and the frequency of safety alerts, shedding light on the complex interplay between speed and alert occurrences.

## Conclusion

The analysis offers valuable insights into the effectiveness of ADAS in detecting and addressing potential hazards on the road, highlighting patterns in alert occurrences and their correlation with driving behavior and road conditions.
